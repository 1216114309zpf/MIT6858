To design a profile worm, we should finish the following three steps:
1, steal zoobars from the victim, this is the effect of the worm;
2, copy the worm(attacker's profile) to the victim's profile;
3, reset the attacker's zoobar to 10, so the victim will not find it;

all these steps will be performed after the page has loaded.

both steal-zoobar and copy-worm need form submittion operation, so we must
contain invisible forms in the worm and submit these forms automatically
with specific value when the page has loaded.

the form submission can be performed in javascript.
