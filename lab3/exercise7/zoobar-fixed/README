To fix bugs for lab 3 exercise 7, copy any files you want to modify
from the zoobar directory to this directory.  Please keep the original
files in the zoobar directory unchanged, so that "make check" continues
working for previous exercises.

Just check the file typescript, we can esaily find that "Balance mismatch" is 
caused by sending zoobars to oneself, and "Zoobar theft" is caused by sending
negative zoobars to someone else, thus to fix these bugs we just add the following
checks:
  if sender == recipient or zoobars < 0:
        raise ValueError()
in file bank.py
