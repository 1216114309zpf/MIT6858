This exercise requires us to enforce to gurantees:
1, if no new users are registered, the sum of Zoobar balance in all accounts should remain the same
  before and after every request.
2, if a user u doesn't request any zoobar transfer request, its zoobars should not shrink.

For the first gurantees, we first check if there are new regitered users or deleted users, if none,
then we check if the total balance have changed, if so, we just call the function report_balance_mismatch().
    if people_before == people_after and \
          set(zoobars_before.keys()) == set(zoobars_after.keys()) and \
             balance_before != balance_after:
       report_balance_mismatch()

For the second gurantees, we first find those users who does not require a zoobar transfer through checking
database Transfer and Person, and then we check if its zoobars has shrunk after the test, if so, we call
the function report_zoobar_theft()
    for people in pdb.query(zoobar.zoodb.Person).all():
      if people.username not in senders and \
         people.username in zoobars_before and \
         people.username in zoobars_after and \
         zoobars_before[people.username] > zoobars_after[people.username]:
              report_zoobar_theft()
