1, Make return address align to 4 bytes. in "exploit-3b.py
   Although we know the distance between buffer "pn" and the return address, the program will put 
 environment variable "DOCUMENT_ROOT" in the beginning of the buffer "pn". So we must pad some bytes
 to make length of "DOCUMENT_ROOT" and the padding be times of 4 bytes. we can check "DOCUMENT_ROOT"
 's length in the local environment and get its length is 16, but in real attack, we can not get this
 information, which means we must try different length of padding...
2, Add a string in the request string. in both "exploit-4a.py" and "exploit-4b.py"
  To exploit return-to-libc or call-libc, we must offer a pointer to a string ("/home/httpd/grades.txt")
 to the function "unlink", and we contains this string in the request string, a string must be ended with
 a '\0', while we can't contains such a string in the request string, since the request string must be 
 intact. Fortunately, the server program will replace the ' ' before "HTTP" with a '\0', so we just put
 the string ("/home/httpd/grades.txt") in the end of the "path", which is before "HTTP".
