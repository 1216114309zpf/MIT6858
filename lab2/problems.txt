Problem1: In exercise3, it seems that gid can be set only after uid has been set, or exercise4 fails,why?
Partial answer: still set gid before uid, but set zook.conf as follows:
       [dynamic_svc]
       cmd = zookfs
       url = /zoobar/index.cgi.*
       uid = 8200
       gid = 8202
       dir = /jail
       # You can control what executables zookfs will run as CGI scripts
       # by specifying the UID/GID of allowed CGI executables, as follows;
       # uncomment and replace 123 and 456 with your intended UID and GID:
       args = 8200 8201
the only difference is that I change gid from 8201 to 8202. but now we can pass exercise4.
I think the reason is that zookfs will compile each python file into something "*.pyc", and all the compiled
file will get "owner:group" as "uid:gid" thus they will have the same "owner:group" attribute with
"/jail/zoobar/index.cgi" and these compiled file will be able to be executed by zookfs, just as 
"/jail/zoobar/index.cgi" do. so it's easy to see if we just change gid to make it different from the second 
argument of "args", we will pass exercise4.
So now the question is why we set uid before gid without modifying gid can also pass exercise?
